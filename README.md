After Cohort Plan
=============
let's descover a way of making a schedule to keep learning and refreshing the concepts we learnet, 
and also learn new stuffs maybe by sharing together of buying new courses on udemy.

`
after some researches, i found some courses that provides the same datastructures content we had in the academy, im going to download them and mention that in the descussion.
`

i found this course which is related to the matter we discussed.

### this is the course we are going to go through in our meetings

before we get into the schedule we need to choose some websites to keep ourselves on solid state system
this is a post on quora on the differences between HackerRank and LeetCode.

[What is the difference between HackerRank and LeetCode?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-HackerRank-and-LeetCode/answer/Duncan-Smith-23)


another post on meduim

[About LeetCode and the Recruiting Process in Silicon Valley](https://medium.com/@teamblind/about-leetcode-and-the-recruiting-process-in-silicon-valley-d91eab67106#:~:text=What%20Is%20LeetCode%3F,Topcoder%2C%20InterviewBit%2C%20among%20others.)

what we need to focus on right now, as "shnable" said is to make a practical plan to keep ourselves updated.

*this is the hardest part though*

| :---|:----:|
| 1 | Arrays |
| 2 | Sort algorithms | 
| 3 | Linked Lists |
| 4 | Stacks | 
| 5 | Queues |

- night study, we prepare the material for next morning.
- in the morning we make a descussion about the concept we studied before and we try to implement the algorithm together.
`we chose this methodology since it's beneficial in our case â˜»`
- solve a leetcode problem after that
`and as someone said "leetcode a day keeps unimployment away" :P`

---

time options:

- maximum 2 hours.

---

1. concepts in the first hour.
2. implementing the algorithm, in the second hour.
