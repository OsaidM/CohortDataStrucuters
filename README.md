After Cohort Plan
=============
let's descover a way of making a schedule to keep learning and refreshing the concepts we learnet, 
and also learn new stuffs maybe by sharing together the resources :).

`
after some researches, i found some courses that provides the same datastructures content we had in the academy, im going to download them and mention that in the descussion.
`

i found this course which is related to the matter we discussed.

### this is the course we are going to go through in our meetings

** download link for the course and it's not legal btw ðŸ˜‹, but hey do you care ? **

#### *we chose this course to go instead of the second one which is using javascript in his course*.

[Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCqVRbZlbg&list=PLCInYL3l2AajqOUW_2SwjWeMwf4vL4RSp)
a very nice channel with nice explanation for the data structures in **ARABIC**.

[Algorithms](https://github.com/urianchang/Algorithms)
a GITHUB that has algorithms with its solutions, algorithms book of coding dojo is inculded!

[tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/dsa_queue.htm)
a very cool website that provides you with the basic operations for each data structure

[techiedelight](https://www.techiedelight.com/Category/Array/)
a very cool one that provides you with necessary code for most the datastructres

**additional resources:**
- [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/?ref=leftbar)
- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)
  - this site is using **javascript**

there are some other courses related to react and MySql, deserves mentioning in this guide:\

these links are just for anyone who is searching for additional resources and materials, btw **REDUX** is so important for `react` keep an for it.

before we get into the schedule we need to choose some websites to keep ourselves on solid state system
this is a post on quora on the differences between HackerRank and LeetCode.

[What is the difference between HackerRank and LeetCode?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-HackerRank-and-LeetCode/answer/Duncan-Smith-23)


another post on meduim

[About LeetCode and the Recruiting Process in Silicon Valley](https://medium.com/@teamblind/about-leetcode-and-the-recruiting-process-in-silicon-valley-d91eab67106#:~:text=What%20Is%20LeetCode%3F,Topcoder%2C%20InterviewBit%2C%20among%20others.)

what we need to focus on right now, as "shnable" said is to make a practical plan to keep ourselves updated.

*this is the hardest part though*

| # | Data Structure |
| :---|:----:|
| 1 | Arrays |
| 2 | Sort algorithms | 
| 3 | Linked Lists |
| 4 | Stacks | 
| 5 | Queues | 
| 6 | Hashtables | 
| 7 | Search algorithms | 
| 8 | Trees | 
| 9 | Heaps |

names needs to be mentioned for helping improving the resources Section:
  - Jihad J
  - Hadeel Y
  - Rahaf H

---

- night study, we prepare the material for next morning.
- in the morning we make a descussion about the concept we studied before and we try to implement the algorithm together.


`we chose this methodology since it's beneficial in our case ðŸ˜Š`
- solve a leetcode problem(algorithm) after that


`and as someone said "leetcode a day keeps unimployment away" ðŸ¤ `

---

time options:

- maximum 2 hours.

---

1. concepts in the first hour.
2. implementing the algorithm, in the second hour.
3. after the second hour everyone is free to go, but we recomend in our case to solve a leetcode problem(algorithm). and then you are reaaaaaally free to go. so it's optional `illa shway`.
---

everyday practical

- everyday we will be choosing a member of the group to prepare the next topic of the data structure and on that:
  - he/she needs to prepare slides for his topic.
  - including the main concepts
  - including full implementation


**meeting on 11/3/2021 to discuss the time and any suggestions about the methodology in use**
  

Meeting sumarry:
- Everyday practice
  -  for each data structure :
	-  clear definition
	-  its Operations (for example the operations on Queue are Enque, Deque) you can see this site for additional information [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/dsa_queue.htm)
	-  use cases
	-  important implementations as required
	-  common interview questions about it.
	-  the implementation language in **JAVA**
  -  every meeting must choose the next group that should prepare for the next data structure 
  -  preparation for each data structure preferably a day before the meeting.
- **and please make sure to `VOTE` for the time that suites you the best.**


**keep an eye on discord for the latest updates.**

## And please keep these points in mind
`
  - We are here to learn from each others.
  - **Everyone should be responsible to make this work in the best way**

And in the end of everyday we say ` O GOD give us the best of this, and the best of everything`.
**stay safe and keep your spirits up.**
